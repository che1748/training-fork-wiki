High performance computing is overwhelmingly done on a Unix (or Linux) operating system. You will need to become familiar with Unix and the terminal. In addition, you will need to be able to connect to the FSL supercomputing clusters from a local machine of your choice.  
If you are unfamiliar with Unix/Linux, read through the FSL’s Unix tutorial. (Another good resource is this tutorial from the Minnesota Supercomputing Institute.) You should also spend some time practicing what you are reading about. A good way to practice is to use this online Unix terminal. It is a bit slow, but it is a useful place to start.  
Once you are familiar with Unix commands, you will need to decide what computer you will use for doing research. You will use this computer to communicate with the super-computer, for coding and to do other research tasks. You have three different options for a local computer to do your work: (1) a personal laptop, (2) a CAEDM lab computer, or (3) a computer in my student offices. (Note: As of 7/24/2017, I do not yet have a computer set up for undergraduates. If you need one, please contact me ASAP so I can do this.)  
The operating system that is installed on the local machine has an impact on the software you can use to do your work. Because the super-computers run Linux, it is often convenient to use a local machine that is also running Linux. However, this is not necessary, and may not be desirable if you do not feel comfortable with it. This is a choice you will have to make for yourself; I have no preference what you use, I simply want you to be productive :).  
There are CAEDM computers available with Linux, and the machine in my lab is a Linux box. If you have a personal laptop, you may decide to experiment with installing Linux alongside Windows or in a virtual machine. (Note: there are many “flavors” of Linux that you can install. Ubuntu is a particularly user-friendly version that you may want to look up, if you decide to go this route.) Again, this is up to you.  
Once you have decided what machine and operating system to use, attempt to log in to the FSL head node at ssh.fsl.byu.edu. Procedures for different operating systems are outlined below. Some additional information can be found on the FSL website.  
### Linux/Mac
If the operating system on your local machine is some flavor of Linux then connecting to or transferring data with the FSL clusters is straightforward via the terminal with SSH, SCP and RSYNC. Mac machines are Unix machines under the hood, and they also have a terminal. As such they can also access the FSL via SSH, SCP or RSYNC. More details about these commands can be found by a Google search.  
### Windows
Windows does not natively connect to Linux/Unix systems without additional software. Connecting via ssh can be done with a program called Putty. You will need to follow the instructions at the Putty website to install it on windows and to connect to the FSL.  
Unfortunately, Putty cannot do file transfers. A common FTP client for transferring files is FileZilla. Again, you will need to follow the instructions at the website to install FileZilla and to learn to use it to transfer files.
You have two other potential options for both ssh and FTP commands. Bitvise is a putty-like program that combines SSH and FTP commands into a single software package. I have never used it, but details on installation and use can be found on its website.  
Finally, Windows has recently begun a project to incorporate a native Linux shell. Again, I have never tried this route, but it seems promising. Details regarding installation and use can be found at this website.
Before moving on from this task, you should:
* Have chosen a local machine and operating system,
* Be able to log on to/log off from the FSL,
* Be able to create, move, and delete files and directories on the cluster,
* Be able to copy files and directories to/from your local machine to the cluster
