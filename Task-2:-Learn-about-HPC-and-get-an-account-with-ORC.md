Log on to https://marylou.byu.edu/ and request an account with the ORC. To complete this process you will need to describe the research project. Use the following paragraph, unless we have discussed something different.

_I will be doing research with Prof. Douglas Tree in the Chemical Engineering Department as part of his undergraduate software development team. As part of this team, I will be working on developing massively parallel software to study polymer materials and other complex fluids. We anticipate that this software will typically run on multiple CPUs or on GPUs, and take several hours or days to complete._

It might take a couple of days before your account is approved so don't worry if you don't get access right away. If it has been three or more days and you still don't have an active account, email me. When you do set up your account make sure to also set up two-factor authentication, otherwise you won't be able to log into the cluster.

In addition, you need to learn a little bit about high performance computing (HPC). Watch the [first two (of six) introductory videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1r9BxHBG0I&list=PL326A5EB4E3B16FED&feature=plpp_play_all) that the ORC has provided on YouTube about HPC. Additionally, spend a few minutes reading this [introduction to parallel computing](https://computing.llnl.gov/tutorials/parallel_comp/) from Lawrence Livermore National Lab. (But donâ€™t take too much time reading the whole thing. It is quite long.)

Before moving on from this task, you should:  
* Have an active ORC account, and
* Understand basic concepts about HPC.
