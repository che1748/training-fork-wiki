C++ is a very powerful computer programming language that can be used to write large, efficient  programs. With this power comes added complexity. Don’t worry about mastering all of C++ at once. Instead, focus on the basics: a “hello world” code, variables, loops, functions, classes, and file I/O.  
With that in mind, go through this tutorial at cplusplus.com. Unlike Python, C++ is a compiled language. So, to practice you will need to learn about how to compile your code into an executable. The MSI has a short tutorial about compiling that should help. You should be able to use either the GNU or Intel compilers on the FSL clusters.  
As C++ programs become larger, they are typically divided into many different files. Compiling all of these files by hand can be cumbersome. The make utility was designed to overcome this problem, and makefiles are commonly encountered when programming in 
C++. Take a look at this tutorial and this tutorial to learn a little bit more about makefiles.  
There are many books that give more information on C++. You might consider going to the library to check out a book to help you get started. StackOverflow has compiled a very useful list of references that will help you guide your search. (As an aside, StackOverflow is a great place to go when you have programming ques-tions. Cplusplus.com is also a useful reference.) There are many more useful documents that you may also consider reading, including this article on debugging, and this introduction to the Standard Template Library.  
Before moving on from this task, you should:  
* Be able to write a “hello world” code in C++ that compiles and runs on a FSL machine,
* Be able to use variables, loops, if/else statements, functions, classes and file I/O,
* Know what a makefile is, and
* Spend a little bit of time exploring some more advanced C++ concepts.
