Once you have chosen a local machine and you can log into the FSL head node, you need to learn some basic Bash scripting and how to submit jobs to the FSL queue.  
Before you can write any Bash or Slurm commands however, you need to choose a text editor. A text editor is a program like Notepad, Gedit, Emacs or Vim (among many others) where you can type code. A text editor will be one of your main research tools. A good text editor (i.e. not MS Notepad) will have features such as syntax highlighting that will make it easier to write readable code. I use Vim. It has many  useful features, and is available from the command line on practically every Linux machine. However, there is some overhead associated with learning vim. Like the choice of machine and operating system, you should chose a text editor that is the most productive for you.  
Additionally, you may want to consider an integrated development environment (IDE). IDEs are text editors coupled with debugging tools. I don’t use one, but some people really like them. Examples include MS Visual Studio (Windows), XCode (Mac) and Eclipse (any).  
Bash is the default language for most Unix command prompts. You can write scripts which are files that contain many bash commands, which you can use to automate routine tasks. Go through this bash tutorial. Don’t just read it. Practice what you are learning with your text editor and a terminal on either your local machine or on FSL.  
Once you feel reasonably comfortable writing bash scripts, you need to learn how to run  them on the supercomputer’s compute nodes.  Scripts are submitted as jobs to a scheduler, and are put in a queue before being run. The scheduler being used at the FSL is called Slurm. Watch the four remaining introductory videos on the FSL website which talk about Slurm. Additionally, read FSL’s documentation about Slurm. It is pretty terse, so take a look at LLNL’s document-ation (user manual, quick start guide) as well. Another useful tool is FSL’s Slurm script generator, which may help you generate an initial script. Make sure you practice submitting scripts to the scheduler in addition to reading the doc-umentation.
Before moving on from this task, you should:  
* Have chosen a text editor you feel comfortable with,
* Be able to write a basic bash script for automating tasks, and
* Be able to submit scripts to the scheduler using Slurm commands.
