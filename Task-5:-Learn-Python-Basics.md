Python is an interpreted programming language that is very useful for doing quick programming tasks like pre- or post-processing data and making plots. You may have already used Python if you have taken Ch En 263. Regardless, go through [this tutorial](https://engineering.ucsb.edu/~shell/che210d/python.pdf) by Scott Shell at UCSB on the basics of scientific programming with Python.  
\
Python also has a robust plotting module called matplotlib. Work through the [matplotlib tutorial](https://matplotlib.org/users/pyplot_tutorial.html) to learn about how to make plots using Python. Again, practice what you are reading about. (If you have already taken Ch En 263, you will obviously move faster through this material than you otherwise might.) Practice will be especially effective if you try and write the codes from memory without looking at the tutorial. It will be harder to do, but you will remember the material better. For additional information on the Python language, see the [official documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/index.html) on the web.

As you will see in the tutorials, you can practice your code in the interactive shell that comes with python in Linux or as scripts that you execute in the terminal. Additionally, you may want to install [iPython](https://ipython.org/index.html) for a more powerful interactive shell.  
\
[Spyder](https://www.spyder-ide.org/) is an IDE-style alternative to the traditional terminal environment for prog-ramming in Python. If you have used Matlab before, you will find that Spyder gives you an very similar look and feel to the Matlab IDE. Spyder can be installed in Windows, Mac or Linux.  
\
As I mentioned in the introduction, Python is a large and complex programming language. Don’t worry if you don’t master every aspect of the language. Instead, focus on the basics outlined below.  
\
Before moving on from this task, you should:  

* Be able to write a “hello world” code in Python that runs on an ORC machine,
* Be able to make and save a plot, and
* Be able to use variables, loops, if/else statements and read and write from files.
