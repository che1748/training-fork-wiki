In order for you to make meaningful progress on your research, you need to put in a minimum of about 10 hours a week. This is a significant time investment, and it is common for dedicated students to find this challenging. To help you keep this goal, I would like you to keep a time sheet while you are doing the training. Your time sheet will also help me learn about your particular skills and experience. An example time sheet is included with this document.
Before moving on from this task, you should:
*	Have a time sheet, and
*	Read/skim through the entire tutorial.
