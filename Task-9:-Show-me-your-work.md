Congratulations! You have completed the training and have learned a lot about high performance computing. Your last task is to come talk to me and show me your work.  
\
It is likely that you have had questions and struggles along the way, and we will have talked some already. Either way, make an appointment to come talk to me in my office. You can show me what you have accomplished, and we will get started on the research project I have in mind for you.

Remind me to add you to the following accounts:  
* github  
* dropbox  
* gaucho  
* fsl group  
* J drive group (caedm)
