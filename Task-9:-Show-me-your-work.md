Congratulations! You have completed the training and have learned a lot about high performance computing. Your last task is to come talk to me and show me your work.  
\
It is likely that you have had questions and struggles along the way, and we will have talked some already. Either way, make an appointment to come talk to me in my office. You can show me what you have accomplished, and we will get started on the research project I have in mind for you.  
\
If you haven't done so, please send me an email to remind me to add you to the following accounts:  
* Github  
* Dropbox  
* gaucho (group computational server)
* ORC group  (shared folder space provided by ORC)
* CAEDM J drive group (shared folder space provided by college) 
* Slack (for remote communication)
* Group email list

In this email, please include the following information:
* Email address
* Phone number
* GitHub ID/username (if possible, it is easiest for me if all of the usernames stay the same)
* ORC username
* CAEDM username
* gaucho username
* Expected graduation date
* Are you thinking about going to grad school?
* Rank order your reasons for joining the group:
  + Paying job related to my major
  + Interested/Want to learn more/get experience with coding
  + Want to go to grad school
I need some of this info to add you to these different accounts and some of it is really useful as I administer the group.
