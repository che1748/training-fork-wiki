It can be difficult to keep track of different versions of a code when it is shared among many authors. Version control systems (VCS) were written as a solution to this problem. Git is a popular and useful VCS that we use in the group. Github is a web hosting service for Git repositories that allows us to easily share code.  
\
Read the [first three chapters](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2) of the Pro Git book to learn the basics of Git. (Atlassian, the company that runs Bitbucket (another git web hosting service), also has some  [useful tutorials](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials).) Again practice is important. You can practice by making a local repository containing your C++ and Python codes that you have written during previous tasks.  
\
Once you have a local repository, and have mastered the basics of committing and branching, go to [Github.com](https://github.com/) and set up an account. Github offers free accounts to academic users, you don't have to use your byu email address but to get all of the student features you will have to add it later. 
\
Once you have an account, you will need to do two things to get Bitbucket to track your local repository: (i) [set up ssh](https://help.github.com/en/enterprise/2.15/user/articles/adding-a-new-ssh-key-to-your-github-account) and (ii) [push your local repo](https://help.github.com/en/articles/adding-an-existing-project-to-github-using-the-command-line) to github.  
\
Before moving on from this task, you should:  

* Know how to set up a git repository, how to commit, and how to create, delete and merge branches,
* Have a Bitbucket account,
* Be able to push from your local repo to your Bitbucket account and pull from Bitbucket to your local repo.
