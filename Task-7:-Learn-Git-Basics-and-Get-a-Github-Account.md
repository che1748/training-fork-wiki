It can be difficult to keep track of different versions of a code when it is shared among many authors. Version control systems (VCS) were written as a solution to this problem. Git is a popular and useful VCS that we use in the group. Github is a web hosting service for Git repositories that allows us to easily share code.  
\
Read the [first three chapters](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2) of the Pro Git book to learn the basics of Git. (Github also has some [useful tutorials](https://help.github.com/en).) Again practice is important. You can practice by making a local repository containing your C++ and Python codes that you have written during previous tasks.  
\
Once you have a local repository, and have mastered the basics of committing and branching, go to [Github.com](https://github.com/) and set up an account. Github offers free accounts to all users but students get some extra perks when signing up. See [this tutorial](https://help.github.com/en/articles/applying-for-a-student-developer-pack#applying-for-a-github-student-developer-pack) for information on how to do that.  
\
Once you have an account, you will need to do two things to get Github to track your local repository: (i) [set up ssh](https://help.github.com/en/enterprise/2.15/user/articles/adding-a-new-ssh-key-to-your-github-account) and (ii) [push your local repo](https://help.github.com/en/articles/adding-an-existing-project-to-github-using-the-command-line) to github.

Before moving on from this task, you should:  

* Know how to set up a git repository, how to commit, and how to create, delete and merge branches,
* Have a Github account,
* Be able to push from your local repo to your Github account and pull from Github to your local repo.
