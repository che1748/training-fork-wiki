It can be difficult to keep track of different versions of a code when it is shared among many authors. Version control systems (VCS) were written as a solution to this problem. Git is a popular and useful VCS that we use in the group. Bitbucket is a web hosting service for Git repositories that allows us to easily share code.  
Read the first three chapters of the Pro Git book to learn the basics of Git. (Atlassian, the company that runs Bitbucket, also has some  useful tutorials.) Again practice is important. You can practice by making a local repository containing your C++ and Python codes that you have written during previous tasks.  
Once you have a local repository, and have mastered the basics of committing and branching, go to Bitbucket.org and set up an account. Bitbucket offers free accounts to academic users, so please use your official BYU email address when signing up to Bitbucket.  
Once you have an account, you will need to do two things to get Bitbucket to track your local repository: (i) set up ssh and (ii) push your local repo to bitbucket.  
Before moving on from this task, you should:  
* Know how to set up a git repository, how to commit, and how to create, delete and merge branches,
* Have a Bitbucket account,
* Be able to push from your local repo to your Bitbucket account and pull from Bitbucket to your local repo.
